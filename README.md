# CVE JSON to CSV Converter
This is a Python script I created to convert a JSON file with CVE data into a CSV file. It helps turn the data into a format that's easier to work with for analysis.

## Features
- Converts CVE JSON data to CSV format
- Extracts CVE details like description, CVSS score, CVSS V2 Vector, status, and comments
- Uses API requests and web scraping for data collection
- Uses an additional allitems.csv file for status and comments

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- requests library
- selenium library
- cvss library
- Google Chrome and ChromeDriver
